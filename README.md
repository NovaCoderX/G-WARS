# G-WARS
A retro Amiga shooter inspired by XBox Geometry Wars 

This is my first ever original Amiga game inspired by the classic
XBOX 360 shooter Geometry Wars (a 2025 release!).
This is not a port of Geometry Wars, it's all my own code developed
over the past 6 months (basically I just made it up as I went along).
I used my old PC 3D engine PolyNova to generate the 3D objects and then
used SDL with OpenGL support (Mesa) to render the polygons.
Although this release targets the Amiga, it doesn't contain any Amiga
specific code so it should be highly portable to other retro platforms.
This game was developed using C++ exclusively.

To build it requires SDL 1.2 and SDL Mixer, SDL must have basic OpenGL
support built in.   

I just used Mesa for the Amiga port.

You will need the resources from the Amiga release version to run it.
